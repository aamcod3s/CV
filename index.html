    I am an aspiring Front-End Developer. I enjoy learning by research, trial, and  error. 
    My journey began in Arizona at <em>Scottsdale Community College</em> where I completed the standard pre-requisites 
    as well as my first CS focused course, <em>Intro to Computer Science: <strong>(JAVA).</strong></em> 
    After relocating back to Oregon, I decided to take time off school to obtain my 
    Real Estate License and join my relatives in opening a family office. Although the office has been a success, 
    I've been unable to keep my mind from wondering "What if?". That is why I've decided 
    to continue my education, only this time, I am going the self-taught route. This is because after researching CS 
    education, I'd discovered although un-conventional, the self-taught pathway is obtainable. Being as self-driven, 
    motivated and competitive as I am, it became clear to me that this path was the one for me, and I am up for the challenge!
